In this repository, Frequency Domain Maximum Likelihood Identification with Gaussian Input–Output Uncertainty have been investigated.
the algorithem is based on the following paper:
* Verbeke, Dieter, and Masoud Moravej Khorasani. "Frequency domain maximum likelihood identification with Gaussian input–output uncertainty." IEEE Control Systems Letters 4.1 (2019): 109-114.
